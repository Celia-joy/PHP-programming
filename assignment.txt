Group 3 focuses on reading and modifying file content in PHP,
covering several key implementations: displaying file content
on a web page involves using functions like file_get_contents()
to read the file into a string and then outputting it via echo 
or print within HTML for browser rendering; searching in file content 
can be done by loading the content and applying string functions such as
strpos() or preg_match() to find specific terms or patterns; formatting file
content entails processing the text, for instance, by trimming whitespace with 
trim(), replacing multiple spaces using preg_replace(), or converting newlines
to HTML breaks with nl2br() to improve readability; saving changes requires opening 
the file in write mode with fopen(), writing modified content via fwrite(), 
and ensuring the updates are persisted; closing files is essential for resource management,
achieved by calling fclose() on the file handle after operations to prevent memory leaks or locks;
and deleting files uses the unlink() function to permanently remove the file from the filesystem,
with checks like file_exists() beforehand to avoid errors.
