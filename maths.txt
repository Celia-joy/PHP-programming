Algebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics.It generalizes arithmetic
by using letters and symbols (variables) to represent numbers and quantities
in formulas and equations. It focuses on understanding mathematical structures,
solving for unknowns, and describing relationships between varying quantities.

Algebra is heavily applied in daily life for tasks involving unknown variables,
such as:
 Budgeting & Financial Planning: Calculating savings, interest rates on loans, or managing daily expenses.
 Cooking & Baking: Scaling recipes up or down by adjusting ratios of ingredients.
 Travel & Speed: Determining departure times based on distance and speed (\(d=rt\)).
 Shopping: Calculating unit prices, discounts, taxes, and total costs.
 Construction & Home Improvement: Measuring areas and volumes for materials like tiles, paint, or flooring.
 Sports & Fitness: Calculating body mass index (BMI), tracking workout progress, or predicting performance.
 Technology & Computing: Algorithms, software coding, and computer graphics rely on variables and formulas.
 Decision Making: Comparing options, such as mobile phone plans, to find the most cost-effective choice.
